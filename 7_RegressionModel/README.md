# Course Description
Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions.  Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientistâ€™s toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.

This class has three main components

1. Least squares and linear regression
2. Multivariable regression
3. Generalized linear models

## What I've learned

* dffits - change in predicted response when ith point deleted
* dfbetas - change in coefficeints when ith point deleted
* hatvalues - measures of leverage
* r standard - residuals / sd
* r student - standardized, but with ith data point deleted
* Cook's distance - overall change in coefficient when ith point deleted
* VIF - increase in variance of a coef ifdue to it's correlation with other regressors
* anova
* f statistics - ratio of SS divided by rdf. If the two scaled sums are independent and centrally chi-squared distributed with the same variance, the statistic will have an F distribution with parameters given by the two degrees of freedom.
* Shapiro-Wilk test - test residuals for normality
